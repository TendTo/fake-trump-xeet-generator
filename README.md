# Fake Trump Xeet Generator

[LIVE DEMO](https://tendto.github.io/fake-trump-xeet-generator/)

## Description

Ok, so listen, this is the best "Xeet Generator" tool in existence tool—a really special kind of thing, believe me—that can spit out xeets just like only the man himself does, and I gotta say, that’s pretty huge.
It's gotta be firing off messages that are short, kinda loud, and really, really sharp—like a punch, folks. Almost like you’re throwing fastballs right down the middle. BOOM. Every time.

Thing they built, it’s not just some boring little app, alright?
We’re talkin’ about a real masterpiece.
A beauty.
Probably the best, and I mean that.
This thing generates xeets so perfectly, so clean, so powerful, you’d think they came straight from his own huge thumbs.

So, we’re talkin’ about a system—probably something built on AI, but not the sleepy, slow kind. No, no. This would be like a big league brain, trained on years and years of perfect, beautiful xeets.
Caps locked when needed.
Punctuation? Who cares.
You want bold words, like “DISASTER,” “WINNING,” “FAKE NEWS,” maybe a little “SAD!” at the end—just to seal the deal, right?

Some say it revolutionized the way we think about xeets.
I say it’s really something special.

Now, the "Xeet Generator" doesn’t mess around.
It studies every classic xeets—yes, even the “covfefe” one, ok?—and it learns the rhythm.
Not just words, but the feeling. Like, you hit send and people instantly feel like they’ve been hit with a golden truth hammer.
Short lines.
Big impact.
It doesn’t try to be clever.
It tells it like it is.
Sometimes it throws in “Believe me.”
Sometimes it ends with “Sad!” when needed.
That’s how you know it’s real.

Frankly, this things is so strong, so sharp, Xitter will integrate it soon on its front page. Probably melt the servers from all the rexeets.
That’s how perfect it is.
Awesome energy.
Full blast.
The based love it.

## Template

This software is so advanced that does not even need to use any AI to be accurate.
Which I guess is telling you something about the intelligence needed to generate this particular kind of Xeet.
Instead, it uses a template that is so perfect, so efficient, that it can generate a Xeet in seconds.

> Happy [holiday], including all the [enemys] that [wild accusation that doenst make sense] and [completely unrelated event to anything].
> This could only happen because [non-related body] and [descriptive insult] [singled out political figure] [other insult].
> From now on I will [random MAGA punchline], so that the [people that are not affected] can finally be great and no longer fear [problem that doesnt exist we made up].
>
> Again, Happy [holiday], and [god / maga reference]

## TODO

If anyone wants to contribute, here are some ideas.
I'm not even from the USA, so there are probably uncountable things that could be added that I don't know about.

- [ ] Improve logo
- [ ] Add more variations to the template (this is just the holiday one)
- [ ] Add many more possible responses
- [ ] Add a way to generate a Xeet with a specific topic
- [ ] Add AI (although it would arguably be a downgrade)
